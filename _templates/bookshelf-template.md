## Book Template Format

### For Adding New Books to Bookshelf:

```markdown
**"Book Title" by Author Name**  
[Goodreads Link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/BOOK_ID)
*Status: Currently Reading / Completed / Want to Read*

Brief personal take on the book (1-2 sentences). What you learned or why it's useful.

Key takeaway or favorite quote (optional).
```

### Example:

```markdown
**"Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann**  
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications)
*Status: Completed*

Dense but worth it. Changed how I think about distributed systems and consistency trade-offs.

"The limits of a single machine are not so far away for many applications."
```

### Template Instructions:
- Keep reviews personal and honest
- Focus on what YOU got from the book
- Include Goodreads links for credibility
