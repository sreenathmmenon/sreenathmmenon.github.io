I've been writing code for over 13 years, mostly working on infrastructure and cloud systems. These days I'm fascinated by how AI can make complex systems more approachable.

Started my career building web applications, then got into cloud infrastructure when OpenStack was still the hot new thing. Now I spend time figuring out how to make infrastructure operations more conversational and less about remembering obscure CLI commands.

## What I'm Working On

Currently exploring how Large Language Models can bridge the gap between natural language and system operations. Built some tools like [llmswap](https://pypi.org/project/llmswap/) to make working with different AI providers easier.

Also experimenting with Anthropic's Model Context Protocol to see if we can make infrastructure management more intuitive.

## When I'm Not Coding

I read a lot about distributed systems and software architecture. Always trying to understand how large-scale systems actually work in practice, not just in theory.

Occasionally write about technical stuff on my [Substack](https://sreenathmmenon.substack.com/), though not as consistently as I'd like.

## Background

Based in Bengaluru, India. B.Tech in Information Technology from Cochin University.

Been fortunate to work on systems that handle real user traffic and see how things break (and fix them) at scale.
