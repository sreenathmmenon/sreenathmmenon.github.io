# Bookmarks

Useful resources I keep coming back to.

## Technical Blogs

**[High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/)**  
Real-world architecture deep dives. The Netflix and Uber case studies are fascinating.

**[Martin Fowler's Blog](https://martinfowler.com/)**  
Still the gold standard for software architecture writing.

**[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)**  
Makes complex systems concepts accessible. Her zines are brilliant.

**[Brendan Gregg's Blog](http://www.brendangregg.com/)**  
The go-to resource for anything performance-related.

## Tools I Use

**[httpie](https://httpie.io/)**  
Much nicer than curl for API testing.

**[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)**  
JSON processor that I somehow always forget the syntax for.

**[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)**  
Faster grep that actually changed my daily workflow.

**[lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)**  
Git TUI that makes complex git operations visual.

## Learning Resources

**[Anthropic's Model Context Protocol Docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)**  
New but promising. Been experimenting with this lately.

**[OpenStack API Reference](https://docs.openstack.org/api-quick-start/)**  
Still the most comprehensive cloud infrastructure docs I've found.

**[Python Type Hints Cheat Sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)**  
Because I always forget the syntax for complex types.

## Documentation Worth Reading

**[Stripe API Docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api)**  
Best example of how API documentation should be written.

**[Postgres Manual](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)**  
Surprisingly readable for a database manual.
