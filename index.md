# Hi, I'm Sreenath 👋

**Software Engineer passionate about AI, cloud, and open source**

I build tools that bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and production infrastructure. Currently working on making complex systems more accessible through conversational interfaces and intelligent automation.

## What I'm Building

🤖 **[llmswap](https://pypi.org/project/llmswap/)** - Python package for seamless switching between LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama)

🔧 **[OpenStack MCP Server](https://github.com/sreenathmmenon/openstack-mcp-server)** - Natural language infrastructure management for OpenStack environments

⚡ **Infrastructure AI** - Exploring how conversational AI can simplify cloud operations and debugging
