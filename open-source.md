# Open Source Projects

## [llmswap](https://pypi.org/project/llmswap/)
*Python package for switching between LLM providers*

I got tired of switching API keys and rewriting code every time I wanted to try a different LLM provider. So I built this simple package that lets you swap between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Ollama with zero code changes.

```bash
pip install llmswap
```

## [OpenStack MCP Server](https://github.com/sreenathmmenon/openstack-mcp-server)
*Talk to OpenStack in plain English*

Built this to experiment with Anthropic's Model Context Protocol. Instead of remembering OpenStack CLI commands, you can just ask "create a VM with 4GB RAM" and it handles the API calls.

Still rough around the edges, but it works.

## Alexa Skills
*Voice apps I built years ago*

Made a few Alexa skills for fun back when voice assistants were the hot new thing. Nothing groundbreaking, but good learning experience with natural language processing.

That's pretty much it for now. I prefer building things I actually use rather than creating projects just for the portfolio.
